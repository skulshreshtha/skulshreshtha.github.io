subtitle: Strategy Consultant / Data Scientist @Mastercard Advisors / Ex-KPMG / Ex-i3 Consulting / IIT Roorkee
---

My name is Shobhit Kulshreshtha. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Civil Engineering from one of India's most prestigious engineering colleges, Indian Institute of Technology - Roorkee in 2015. Since then, I have worked in Strategy Consulting across 3 different organizations and a wide variety of industries and clients. I have been on the front as well as in the back office.

What I have realized over the last 5 years is that the Management Consulting industry is changing rapidly and consultants need to keep up with the pace. We need to be on top of the latest tools we have at our disposal and engineer better solutions for our clients. With this thought, I kept on learning skills that would help me in making better decisions by analyzing the data at hand.

It has been a great experience so far which led me from making simple reports to advanced dashboards in Excel to building end-to-end analytic apps, automating analyses & utilizing machine-learning techniques for predicting customer behaviour, designing pricing offers, and to using stochastic modelling for revenue/budget forecasting & market sizing.

### Why create this website?

Well, I always wanted to have a web page of my own. Thanks to GitHub, I can own one for free!! Other than that, this website serves 2 purposes:
- It reduces my brain's load by keeping a track of everything that I found useful or have worked upon. I don't need to remember everything
- It provides a platform using which I can connect with people on similar path, help others by sharing my experiences, and learn from theirs

Hope you find the content helpful or at least interesting. Feel free to connect with me using any channels you feel comfortable.
