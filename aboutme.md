subtitle: Helping people realize value in a data-driven world
---

My name is Shobhit Kulshreshtha. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Civil Engineering from one of India's most prestigious engineering colleges, Indian Institute of Technology - Roorkee in 2015. Since then, I have worked in Strategy Consulting across 3 different organizations and a wide variety of industries and clients. I have been on the front as well as in the back office.

What I have realized over the last 5 years is that the Management Consulting industry is changing rapidly and consultants need to keep up with the pace. We need to be on top of the latest tools we have at our disposal and engineer better solutions for our clients. With this thought, I kept on learning skills that would help me in making better decisions by analyzing the data at hand.

It has been a great experience so far which led me from making simple reports to advanced dashboards in Excel to building end-to-end analytic apps, automating analyses & utilizing machine-learning techniques for predicting customer behaviour, designing pricing offers, and to using stochastic modelling for revenue/budget forecasting & market sizing.

Apart from my career and professional interests, I enjoy reading, watching movies, cooking, and travelling. I sincerely hope you find the content helpful or at least interesting. Feel free to connect with me using any of the channels listed at the bottom of every page.
